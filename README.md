Project Title: Building a medulloblastoma tumor subtype classifier through 
analysis of immune cell expression patterns in the four known tumor subtypes

Overview:


Data:
Our project will be using data generated in Riemondy et al 2021 using 
single-cell capture, RNA library preparation, and sequencing. ScRNA-seq was 
performed on 2000 cells per sample with transcripts converted to cDNA, barcoded, 
and libraries sequencing on Illumina NovaSeq6000, obtaining 50,000 reads/cell. 
From this raw sequencing, tumor cells were identified via observation of 
discrete clustering patterns and presence of copy number varients (CNVs) using 
inferCNV. Tumor cells were then reanalyzed using Harmony alignment. 

Data size is such that it is feasible to upload within code stored in repo.
